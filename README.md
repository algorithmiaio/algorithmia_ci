This algorithm uses a new github action called [Algorithmia CI](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/algorithmia-ci). This action publishes a new version of this algorithm when the test cases defined in `TEST_CASES.json` are successful, otherwise an error is thrown describing which test case failed.
